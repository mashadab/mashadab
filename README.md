### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I am Afzal currently working on the following three prominent Earth and Planetary science problems by developing a Two-phase flow in a Viscously Compacting Matrix solver. More info can be found on my academic webpage [https://mashadab.github.io/](https://mashadab.github.io/).
  1. What happened to water on Mars 4 billion years ago?
  2. What is the fate to glaciers due to climate warming?
  3. How did cores of planets formed in our solar system?

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning deep learning and inverse problems.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on exciting research projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Fluid mechanics, applied mathematics, planetary science, high-order numerical methods.
