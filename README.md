### Hello and Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

 I am Afzal, a PhD Candidate in Computational Science, Engineering and Mathematics at the [Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences](https://www.oden.utexas.edu/) at the University of Texas at Austin. My academic webpage is [https://mashadab.github.io/](https://mashadab.github.io/).

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on the three prominent Earth and Planetary Science problems by developing a Two-phase Percolation in a Viscously Compacting Matrix solver:
  1. What is the fate to glaciers due to climate warming?
  2. What happened to water on Mars 4 billion years ago?
  3. How did cores of planets form in our solar system?

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the mathematics and implementation of deep learning and inverse problems.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on exciting research projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Fluid mechanics, Applied mathematics, Planetary science and High-order numerical methods.
