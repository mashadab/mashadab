### Hello and Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

 I am Afzal, a Future Faculty in Physical Sciences Postdoctoral Fellow at Princeton University's Departments of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Geosciences. I am currently working on developing and implementing terrestrial and firn hydrologic models. 
 
 Previously, I was a PhD Candidate in Computational Science, Engineering and Mathematics at the [Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences](https://www.oden.utexas.edu/) at the University of Texas at Austin. My academic webpage is [https://mashadab.github.io/](https://mashadab.github.io/).

- ðŸ”­ In my PhD, I worked on three prominent problems in Earth and Planetary Sciences:
  1. What is the fate of glaciers due to climate warming? Received NASA - JPL Graduate Fellowship and UT Institute for Geophysics Blue Sky Fellowship.
  2. What happened to water on Mars 4 billion years ago? Received Lunar and Planetary Institute Career Development Award.
  3. How can the icy moons of Saturn and Jupiter sustain life below their ice shells? Awarded NASA - JPL Graduate Fellowship and Student Research Award in Planetary Habitability by UT Austin.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the mathematics and implementation of deep learning and inverse problems.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on exciting research projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Fluid mechanics, Applied mathematics, Planetary science and High-order numerical methods.
- ðŸ’¬ I support open science, education, and scholarship.
